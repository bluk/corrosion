# Corrosion

A site with some thoughts about the [Rust][rust-lang] programming language and
related topics such as design, performance, and the surrounding ecosystem.

Jotting down my thoughts at the time I am writing them. Perhaps interesting to
you, but perhaps not.

## Build

The contents are currently intended to be used with [mdBook][mdBook].

To build the site:

```
mdbook build
```

The `book` directory will contain the output of the build.
