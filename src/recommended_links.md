* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

  If you have programming experience, "the book" is probably the best resource
  to learn Rust.

* [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/)

  If you are exploring what is possible, syntax, or just want to understand the
  nuances of the language itself, then the reference is useful. After reading
  the book, the reference is probably an easier way to lookup some quick detail
  about the language.

* [The Rust Nomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)

  If you want to understand even more subtle but important nuances of the
  language, then the nomicon is a good resource. If you are writing `unsafe`
  code, then the nomicon is required reading. It has implementation details and,
  more importantly, the reasoning on what is valid correct code and why.
