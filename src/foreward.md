# Foreward

Consider this "book" a collection of random articles about Rust and related
topics.

I do not intend for this project to be a complete introduction to Rust. The
organization (as well as much of the content) is constantly evolving. There are
a growing number of thoughts, rants, rambings, and the occassional insights.

This project was partially started because a few friends preferred I write down
my thoughts (or "start a podcast") rather than give them another pitch about why
Rust is something worth looking into. :)
